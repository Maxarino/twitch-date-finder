## About The Project

Sometimes you watch a Twitch clip and wanna cross-reference it with a Youtube video / vod to understand the context. There's no way to get the date and time of a clip in the native Twitch app though, which I thought was weird & annoying, so I made this.

## Development

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Maxarino/twitch-date-finder
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py runserver
```

Open another CLI

```sh
cd frontend
npm i
npm start
```
